    aboutMeText: `
    Hi, I'm Rodrigo R. Chagas, a 23-year-old web developer with a focus on backend development using <span>Asp.Net</span>.
    I started my journey into programming at 19 while taking a college course that introduced me to <span>C++</span> and <span>Python</span>.
    <br>

    Since then, I have been continuously expanding my skills in web development. I have experience creating responsive web pages with
    <span>HTML 5</span>, <span>CSS 3</span>, <span>Bootstrap</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>.
    In the second half of 2021, I dedicated myself to learning more about technology, working on projects such as a
    <span>Login System</span>, <span>Bank System</span>, and <span>Crawler</span> application,
    and sending requests to various <span>APIs</span>.

    In the second half of 2021, I dedicated myself to learning more about technology, working on projects such as a <span>SQLServer</span>, <span>RabbitMQ</span>, <span>Elasticsearch</span>,
    <span>Kibana</span>, <span>MLS</span>, <span>Amazon Web Services</span>, <span>Azure DevOpps</span> and <span>Blobb Storage</span>,
    <span>Git and GitHub</span>. Additionally, I have worked as a <span>QA Analyst</span>.

    <br>

    I'm comfortable working with several <span>.Net</span> features and frameworks, such as <span>Cookies management</span>, <span>Identity</span>, <span>Entity
    Framework</span>, <span>Razor/Blazor pages</span>, <span>Jwt
    Tokens</span>, <span>API REST</span>, <span>authentication</span> and <span>authorization</span>.I also have knowledge of <span>DDD</span> and <span>TDD</span> patterns,
    <span>Object-Oriented programming Paradigm</span>, and a solid base on <span>SOLID</span>.

    <br>

    In August 2022, I joined "Employer" as an intern and am currently part of the BNE squad,
    where I gained valuable experience in managing and solving complex problems in a large company's development environment..

    <br>

    Apart from programming, I am a fluent <span>fluent English speaker</span>, and I'm a proactive, persistent individual who excels at
    breaking down complicated situations and handling them efficiently.

    EXPERIENCE
    `,
    experienceText: `
    Prior to entering the software industry, I worked as a <span>Meter Reader</span> at Tellus from January 2020 to April 2021.
    My job involved visiting households, interacting with people, and handing over their electricity bills.
    This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, empathy, patience, and most importantly, the value of work and taking it seriously.<br>

    Currently, I am interning at <span>Employer</span>, one of the leading human resource websites in Brazil, where I am a part of the <span>BNE</span> squad.
    Since joining, I have worked on various projects such as <span>Catalog</span>, <span>CRUD</span>, and <span>Shopping Cart</span>.
    I have also collaborated on the creation of a new website management tool and worked with the company's <span>Crawler</span>,
    using <span>XPath</span> expressions to analyze <span>HTML</span> or <span>XML</span> files and collect data. In addition,
    I have indexed files into a <span>LMS</span> website using <span>AWS</span> services, documented and performed test cases of the entire BNE site as a <span>QA Analyst</span>,
    and quickly resolved bugs by modifying fields in the production database using <span>SQL</span>. I primarily develop with <span>.NET</span>,
    and I am proficient in <span>HTML</span>, <span>C#</span>, <span>Python</span>, <span>C++</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>. `,
